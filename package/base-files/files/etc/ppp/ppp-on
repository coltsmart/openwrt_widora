# Script to initiate a ppp connection. This is the first part of the
# pair of scripts. This is not a secure pair of scripts as the codes
# are visible with the 'ps' command.  However, it is simple.
#
# These are the parameters. Change as needed.
TELEPHONE=555-1212	# The telephone number for the connection
ACCOUNT=horse		# The account name for logon (as in 'George Burns')
PASSWORD=mj		# The password for this account (and 'Gracie Allen')
LOCAL_IP=0.0.0.0	# Local IP address if known. Dynamic = 0.0.0.0
REMOTE_IP=0.0.0.0	# Remote IP address if desired. Normally 0.0.0.0
NETMASK=255.255.255.0	# The proper netmask if needed
#
# Export them so that they will be available at 'ppp-on-dialer' time.
export TELEPHONE ACCOUNT PASSWORD
#
# This is the location of the script which dials the phone and logs
# in.  Please use the absolute file name as the $PATH variable is not
# used on the connect option.  (To do so on a 'root' account would be
# a security hole so don't ask.)

DIALER_SCRIPT=/etc/ppp/ppp-on-dialer
#
# Initiate the connection
#
# I put most of the common options on this command. Please, don't
# forget the 'lock' option or some programs such as mgetty will not
# work. The asyncmap and escape will permit the PPP link to work with
# a telnet or rlogin connection. You are welcome to make any changes
# as desired. Don't use the 'defaultroute' option if you currently
# have a default route to an ethernet gateway.
